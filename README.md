# Punk-Hazard
A space shooter game made in pygame module. This is my final project for Stanford's Code in Place 2021

It is my first project i made using pygame module. This project uses class and object concept which i had to get familiar with. This was challenging for me and i am hoping to get 
better as i progess.
